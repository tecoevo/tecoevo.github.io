**Dates:** June 3-4

**Duration:** Four Hours (split in two days)

**Language:** English

**Schedule:**

**Course Overview:**

This intensive 4-hour course provides a rapid and highly hands-on introduction to the R programming language, focusing on the core concepts and skills needed to start working with data immediately. Participants will learn the essentials of R syntax, fundamental data structures, and key packages for basic data manipulation and visualization through practical exercises. While example datasets will be provided, participants are encouraged to bring their own small datasets if they wish, to explore R's capabilities with data relevant to their own work. This course is designed for beginners with no prior programming experience.
