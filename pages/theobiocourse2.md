**Dates:** January 20 to 31st 2025

**Duration:** Two Weeks (No classes on Thursdays)

**Language:** English

**Schedule:**

Daily Sessions:  10:30 - 1200 and 13:30-1500 hrs
Final Workshop: Discussion of Student Projects on the Last Day

**Course Overview:**

This intensive two-week course in theoretical biology is tailored for Masters's students. 
It gives the students a flavour of theoretical studies' the why, how and what of it. 
Through interactive lectures and demonstrations we describe key concepts and methodologies from across the scales of biological organisation, from evolutionary dynamics, ecological interactions, and cultural evolution.
At the end of the course, the students are expected to provide a short feedback through an oral presentation on their favourite topic.

## Course Topics:

### January 20

Instructors: [Chaitanya S. Gokhale]({{ site.url }}/people/chaitanya/)

**Introduction and Fundamentals of Evolution**: Explore the core principles of evolutionary theory, including mutations, selection, genetic drift and cooperation. Understand the fundamental mechanisms driving the diversity of life on Earth, from molecular processes to social systems.

### January 21 - 22

Instructors: [Axel Arango Garcia](https://axelarango.github.io)

**Macroecology**: Investigate the large-scale patterns and processes in ecological systems. Learn how to analyze spatial and temporal trends in biodiversity, species distribution, and ecosystem function.

Day one - 
	Morning: Day 1: What is Macroecology? & Macroecological theories and patterns. 
	Afternoon: How to test macroecology (Species and Communities approaches) & demonstration in R.
	
Day two - 
	Morning: Species distribution models (SDMs) and potential applications regarding climate change and conservation & Large-scale ecological datasets. 
	Afternoon: How to make an SDM, demonstration in R.

### January 24 - 27

Instructors: [Dharanish Rajendra]({{ site.url }}/people/dharanish/)

**Classical models in Theoretical Ecology**: 

Day One - 
	Learn the theoretical underpinnings of classical ecological models. 
	Morning: Single species models
	Afternoon: Multi-species models

Day two - 
	Explore the extensions of these classical models including bits of realism 
	Morning: Adding spatial structure
	Afternoon: Adding further complexity

### January 28-29

Instructors: [Luis Alejandro Villanueva Hern√°ndez]({{ site.url }}/people/luis), [Chaitanya S. Gokhale]({{ site.url }}/people/chaitanya/)

**Cultural Evolution**: 

Day one - Chaitanya S. Gokhale
	Morning: Evolutionary games: behavioural traits
	Afternoon: Eco-evolutionary games: behaviours to cognition to beliefs
			
Day two - Luis Alejandro Villanueva
	Morning: Cognition, ecology and sociality in Hominid evolution
	Afternoon: Musical practices: Evolution and cultural diversification


### January 31

**Final Workshop:**

A 5-minute pitch from each of the participants on whether they can use any of the concepts discussed in this course for their own projects or do them think of developing new projects from the ideas coming from this course.
