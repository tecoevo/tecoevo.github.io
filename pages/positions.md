## Masters projects <a name="masters"></a>

The group offers a number of projects appropriate for a Masters thesis. If interested in finding out what theoretical biology is about...
*Get in touch*

<!--
- With great power comes great responsibility: The effect of power dynamics on belief and trust spreading. 
	- Individuals with more power in the belief-choosing process
	- Individuals with more power to proliferate 
- Is nonconformism smart or just stubborn? 
	- The effect of introducing stubborn individuals who don't conform to the chosen narrative in the belief model
- What if it was learned? 
	- Introduction of learning dynamics for the beliefs instead of the random mutation process. 
- Eco-evolutionary dynamics of synchronized emergence
Synchronized reproduction evolved in multiple species the presence of environmental cycles. However, within a single species like the marine midge *Clunio marinus*, there exist different emergence patterns within the lunar cycle. Two theoretical frameworks to investigate the possible evolutionary histories of the different strains and emergence patterns:
	- Adaptive dynamics: evolution of traits through mutation and fixation
 	- Reinforcement learning: treating the emergence of an individual as a decision process, what decisions results in the best outcome?

#### Use it or lose it: what determines the regulation mode of a given gene?

**Massey University - Auckland Campus    School of Natural and Computational Sciences**

Please submit your application (or inquiry) via email to the main supervisor of this project: A/Prof. Xue-Xian Zhang (x.x.zhang1@massey.ac.nz).

<!--<span style="color:gray"> The following are some of the topics that the group is interested in developing further. However the exact project is often tailored to the interests of the candidate. We are interested in recruiting interested PhD students through the next round of the [International Max Planck Research School](https://www.evolbio.mpg.de/3017297/application)-->

<!--#### Eco-evolutionary tuning of biological clocks
Biological clocks are oscillating physiological processes which allow organisms to coordinate their life with environmental cycles such as night and day, seasons or tides. They are synchronized with the environment through a process called entrainment. Usually, biological clocks can be entrained by several environmental factors such as light, temperature or humidity. All of those factors are inherently subject to noise. Starting from existing models of entrainment, we would like to develop a mechanistic model for how several noisy factors jointly entrain the clock. This includes stochastic approaches, development of probabilistic models, and demonstrating the robustness of oscillations to environmental noise. In a second step, we would like to study the evolution of such a mechanistic model along with ecological (biotic and abiotic) inputs. We are interested in developing the skills and supporting the career of a student with a background in physics or applied mathematics, keenly interested in evolutionary biology. **Prior experience in the dynamical systems and in particular the theory of phase oscillators is desirable but not required at the start. While offered by Gokhale, the project will develop in close collaboration with the group of [Tobias Kaiser](https://www.evolbio.mpg.de/biologicalclocks).**-->
<!--#### Eco-eco-evolutionary agriculture
Working at the interface of _eco_logy, _eco_nomics and _evo_lution this project takes on the true meaning of translational biology. Feeding more than 7 billion people puts immense pressure on the farming industry — especially since it is required not just for providing food directly to humans but also for feeding livestock. Similar to the antibiotic resistance issue in medicine, we are dealing with ever-evolving more virulent parasites in agriculture. Thousands of years of monocultures have reduced the genetic diversity, as well as the ability of the plants to fight back. This project aims to understand this interaction taking into account different ecological, evolutionary and economic standpoints. Ecologically, we need to ascertain how we are changing the environment by driving artificially selected variants of crops and their potential to disrupt the wild varieties of the host plant. Evolutionarily, the host-pathogen dynamics need to be understood: how do the evolution of pathogen virulence and the eco-evolutionary dynamics change when considering multiple pathogen/crop species? Lastly, all the previous points coalesce at the economic standpoint, to make sure that the farmers do not lose more yield than necessary while keeping the technique sustainable.  **Knowledge about the theory of dynamical systems, stochastic processes and scientific computing would be desirable. A keen interest in interfacing with bioeconomists and field ecologists is a requirement.**-->
<!--#### Co-evolutionary dynamics in the light of extended evolutionary synthesis
Theories of predator-prey, host-parasite dynamics are a part of classical ecology. Together with evolution, we can address Red-Queen like scenarios with ever-evolving antagonists. The extended evolutionary synthesis includes phenomena such as innovation and learning. Personality effects of individual antagonists are often averaged out.
The project aims to incorporate extended evolutionary synthesis properties in the traditional co-evolution models.
The project involves theory development from an ecological and evolutionary point of view with implementations from techniques from machine learning. 
The theory will be developed together with an experimental collaborator working on the individual variation in the predatory behaviour of spiders. 
Primarily developed as a theory project, the ideal candidate is expected to be highly enthusiastic, working at the interface of theory development, machine learning and artificial intelligence and interacting with experimentalists.
**Knowledge about the theory of dynamical systems, stochastic processes, learning algorithms and scientific computing would be desirable. Familiarity with evolutionary and ecological models of co-evolution and mathematical biology would be an advantage, but if not, then a keen interest in the same is a requirement.**-->

### Postdoc position in Theoretical Biology <a name="pd1"></a>

The Theoretical Biology group at the Center for Computational and Theoretical Biology at the University of Würzburg, Germany, is excited to announce a Postdoc position in Theoretical Biology. We are looking for an independent, communicative postdoctoral researcher to join our dynamic team in theoretical biology. Our Center is committed to fostering interdisciplinary collaborative research, and we are seeking candidates with a strong record of originality and the ability to generate innovative project ideas.

**Maximum Duration:** Four-year appointment

**Career Development:** We are dedicated to supporting candidates interested in writing grants and applications to establish their independent profile. The long duration of the position presents an exceptional opportunity for motivated researchers to develop their research programs and gain teaching and mentoring experience.

**Research Focus:**
Theoretical biology is a multi-disciplinary field and often examines complex systems. While theoretical biology is primarily associated with the natural and life sciences, there are some parallels and connections between the concepts and approaches used in theoretical biology and certain areas of the humanities. From ecology and evolutionary biology to behaviour, philosophy of biology, cultural evolution and digital humanities, our group welcomes the breadth while maintaining a connection to the living systems. Our research agenda is centred on exploring the origins and dynamics of the dynamic processes and patterns across various scales of organization, ranging from sub-cellular to societal levels. We desire to uncover fundamental properties of living systems and apply our findings to real-world contexts such as agriculture, conservation, and medicine. For insights into our group’s interests, please visit our publications page on this site.

**Opportunities and Expectations:**
