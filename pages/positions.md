#### Use it or lose it: what determines the regulation mode of a given gene?

**Massey University - Auckland Campus    School of Natural and Computational Sciences**

About the Project
All organisms must tightly control gene expression. In bacteria, gene regulation is mediated by either an activator or a repressor which binds DNA to turn a gene on or off, respectively. The two modes are mechanistically distinct but lead to the same functional outcome. This apparent equivalence raises a fundamental question: what determines the mode of control used for a given gene? The answer to this question is crucial to understanding the consequences of gene regulation in natural systems and for effective engineering of gene circuits in synthetic biology.

In this project, we will experimentally test the Demand Theory in a model bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25. We will focus on regulators of xylose and histidine utilization whose function has been well characterized in our previous studies. The research will involve genetic engineering of P. fluorescens strains, followed by experimental evolution in laboratory media, genome re-sequencing of the evolved strains, and functional characterization of the relevant mutations (e.g., EMSA).

*About the Position*

We invite applications for a funded PhD scholarship to conduct the abovementioned research at the Auckland campus of Massey University. The PhD scholarship includes tuition fees and an annual stipend of NZ$ 35,000 (tax-free) for three years. Applicants must meet the entry requirements for admission to the PhD program at Massey University.

The ideal candidate should have a basic understanding of bacterial gene regulation and/or experimental evolution, and demonstrate an ability to undertake the practical and the theoretical aspects of the project. The supervisory team will include A/Prof. Xue-Xian Zhang and Prof. Tim Cooper at Massey University (Auckland, New Zealand), and Prof. Chaitanya Gokhale. 

*How to Apply*

Please submit your application (or inquiry) via email to the main supervisor of this project: A/Prof. Xue-Xian Zhang (x.x.zhang1@massey.ac.nz).  When applying, please ensure to include the required documents as follows:

* A detailed curriculum vitae.
* Degree certificates and academic transcripts for BSc and MSc (or equivalents).
* A statement of your research interests, including previous experience and career goals.
* Contact details of two academic referees.




<!--<span style="color:gray"> The following are some of the topics that the group is interested in developing further. However the exact project is often tailored to the interests of the candidate. We are interested in recruiting interested PhD students through the next round of the [International Max Planck Research School](https://www.evolbio.mpg.de/3017297/application)-->

<!--#### Eco-evolutionary tuning of biological clocks
Biological clocks are oscillating physiological processes which allow organisms to coordinate their life with environmental cycles such as night and day, seasons or tides. They are synchronized with the environment through a process called entrainment. Usually, biological clocks can be entrained by several environmental factors such as light, temperature or humidity. All of those factors are inherently subject to noise. Starting from existing models of entrainment, we would like to develop a mechanistic model for how several noisy factors jointly entrain the clock. This includes stochastic approaches, development of probabilistic models, and demonstrating the robustness of oscillations to environmental noise. In a second step, we would like to study the evolution of such a mechanistic model along with ecological (biotic and abiotic) inputs. We are interested in developing the skills and supporting the career of a student with a background in physics or applied mathematics, keenly interested in evolutionary biology. **Prior experience in the dynamical systems and in particular the theory of phase oscillators is desirable but not required at the start. While offered by Gokhale, the project will develop in close collaboration with the group of [Tobias Kaiser](https://www.evolbio.mpg.de/biologicalclocks).**-->
<!--#### Eco-eco-evolutionary agriculture
Working at the interface of _eco_logy, _eco_nomics and _evo_lution this project takes on the true meaning of translational biology. Feeding more than 7 billion people puts immense pressure on the farming industry — especially since it is required not just for providing food directly to humans but also for feeding livestock. Similar to the antibiotic resistance issue in medicine, we are dealing with ever-evolving more virulent parasites in agriculture. Thousands of years of monocultures have reduced the genetic diversity, as well as the ability of the plants to fight back. This project aims to understand this interaction taking into account different ecological, evolutionary and economic standpoints. Ecologically, we need to ascertain how we are changing the environment by driving artificially selected variants of crops and their potential to disrupt the wild varieties of the host plant. Evolutionarily, the host-pathogen dynamics need to be understood: how do the evolution of pathogen virulence and the eco-evolutionary dynamics change when considering multiple pathogen/crop species? Lastly, all the previous points coalesce at the economic standpoint, to make sure that the farmers do not lose more yield than necessary while keeping the technique sustainable.  **Knowledge about the theory of dynamical systems, stochastic processes and scientific computing would be desirable. A keen interest in interfacing with bioeconomists and field ecologists is a requirement.**-->
<!--#### Co-evolutionary dynamics in the light of extended evolutionary synthesis
Theories of predator-prey, host-parasite dynamics are a part of classical ecology. Together with evolution, we can address Red-Queen like scenarios with ever-evolving antagonists. The extended evolutionary synthesis includes phenomena such as innovation and learning. Personality effects of individual antagonists are often averaged out.
The project aims to incorporate extended evolutionary synthesis properties in the traditional co-evolution models.
The project involves theory development from an ecological and evolutionary point of view with implementations from techniques from machine learning. 
The theory will be developed together with an experimental collaborator working on the individual variation in the predatory behaviour of spiders. 
Primarily developed as a theory project, the ideal candidate is expected to be highly enthusiastic, working at the interface of theory development, machine learning and artificial intelligence and interacting with experimentalists.
**Knowledge about the theory of dynamical systems, stochastic processes, learning algorithms and scientific computing would be desirable. Familiarity with evolutionary and ecological models of co-evolution and mathematical biology would be an advantage, but if not, then a keen interest in the same is a requirement.**-->

### Endosymbiosis <a name="pd2"></a>

University of Konstanz evolutionary theory, mathematical
modeling, theoretical biology.
We are seeking a highly motivated and
enthusiastic Postdoc to work on the evolution of endosymbiosis. Join us
on a project to study the evolutionary process and ecological conditions
favoring the evolution of endosymbiosis. We are looking for a highly
motivated postdoctoral researcher who will work with us to gain new
insights into the biologically relevant conditions, evolutionary pathways
and mechanisms that lead to the evolution of obligate endosymbiotic
interactions. The project aims to develop theoretical insights based on
observations from experimental work in Lutz Becks' group and to contribute
to the design of future experiments.

This project is a collaboration between Lutz Becks (University of
Konstanz; https://www.limnologie.uni-konstanz.de/becks), Peter Czuppon
(University of Münster, https://czuppon.net/) and Chaitanya Gokhale
(University of Würzburg, https://tecoevo.github.io/) and aims to develop
theory based on experimental work. Highly motivated candidates with a
PhD in evolutionary theory, mathematical modeling or theoretical biology
are encouraged to apply. Previous work in the context of evolutionary
transitions, the evolution of symbioses or species interactions is an
advantage. Candidates should demonstrate an enthusiasm for basic research
and an interest in mechanistic and phenomenological modeling. The
successful candidate should be able to communicate effectively with
people from a wide range of disciplines.

Funding is available for 18 months with the possibility for extension.

Location: The main place of work will be at the University of Konstanz,
but the postdoc is expected to travel to W?rzburg/M?nster for research
visits. The collaborative research environment in the group is highly
integrative, very international and conducted in English. Konstanz
is a very beautiful and pleasant place to live as it borders the third
largest lake in Central Europe and lies at the foothills of the Alps. The
University of Konstanz is an equal opportunities employer.

Interested candidates should send a CV, a short cover letter highlighting
interests and potential research questions, and contact details of
two professional referees to lutz.becks@uni-konstanz.de. Review of
applications will begin immediately and will continue until the position
is filled.
