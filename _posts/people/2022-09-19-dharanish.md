## Who am I?

<!--I was born and raised in Charbrowo, a small village in the northern part of Poland.
I graduated from the Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Degree (EMJMD) QEM - Models and Methods of Quantitative Economics.
Besides my background in Social Sciences, I’ve always been most interested in mathematical modelling and evolutionary dynamics, with the main focus on Evolutionary Game Theory.
Especially during my Master’s studies at Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne, I’ve been studying different optimization techniques and their application to Game Theory.
In my Master Thesis, I researched the evolution of cooperation in multiplayer, multiple games on multilayer networks, and I will continue to work on those topics during my PhD.-->


## Research interests

<!--The main subjects of my research are evolutionary dynamics in multiplayer and multiple games.
The traditional two-player setup used in Game Theory does not fit many systems observed in real life; thus, the introduction of multiplayer games can lead to more realistic results.
Similarly, most evolutionary games are not played in isolated systems, so multiple games can increase the complexity of a model and help better mimic real-life interactions.
In my work, I focus on introducing both of those factors in the models and assessing their impact on the eco-evolutionary dynamics.
