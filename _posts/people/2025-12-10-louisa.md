## Who am I?

I grew up in the Weserbergland near Höxter and moved to Würzburg for my Bachelor's degree in Biology. 
In October 2025, I started my Master's degree in Biosciences with the main topics of bioinformatics and conservation biology. 
Outside of university, my current hobbies are dancing salsa and playing the piano. 
   
    


## Research interests

After working on the phylogeny of algal group Haptophyta during my Bachelor's thesis, I now want to look further into different aspects of nature conservation and bioinformatics, and how to connect these fields.
