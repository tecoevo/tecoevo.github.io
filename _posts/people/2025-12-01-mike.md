## Who am I?

Originally from Schweinfurt, I completed both my Bachelor of Science in Biology and my Master of Science in Biosciences at the Julius Maximilian University of Würzburg. I joined the Center for Computational and Theoretical Biology (as it was called back then) in March 2022, starting in Markus Ankenbrand's BioMedical Data Science group. I have been working on medical image data such as cardiac magnetic resonance images (MRI) and photon-counting computed tomography (PC-CT) images of the head. My main interests include pretty much anything programming related as well as its application to the realm of biology.

## Research interests

My current project aims to bring together the wealth of data in genomics as well as imaging in databanks such as the UK Biobank to research prospective markers for Fabry's disease as well as quantifing the pathogenicity of variants of the GLA gene involved in Fabry's disease in order to create a fitness landscape model that predicts the fitness for thus far unknown mutations of the GLA gene and whether epistasis plays a major role in Fabry's disease.
