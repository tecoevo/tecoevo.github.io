## Who am I?
I was born and grew up in Eskişehir, Turkey. I am currently doing my bachelors in Middle East Technical University (METU), majoring in molecular biology and genetics. Alongside my studies, I try my best to organize and partake in events of science communication, especially in the field of evolution. Outside the academics I write - poems, stories, actually mostly news articles- and keep trying to get back into learning guitar. 


## Research interests
Although my major is in a different specialized field of biology, my main interests are on evolution and evolutionary ecology. I have been involved in ancient DNA research where we looked at the evolution of obesity through the relationship between mouth microbiota and the host. I am interested in primate evolution, cultural evolution, and how evolutionary processes play out across different scales and systems. My research at the internship I am currently doing at Würzburg University, CCTB is on predatory-prey dynamics.
