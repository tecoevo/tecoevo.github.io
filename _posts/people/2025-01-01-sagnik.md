## Who am I?

Born and raised in a small town in West Bengal, India; I am now pursing a Bachelor's degree in Biotechnology to indulge my passion for theoretical-mathematical and computational biology. I strongly believe that everything in the universe holds a mathematical basis, and wish to devote myself to exploring and unraveling this language of nature. I aim to use mathematical language to understand and model various biological systems. As for other personal interests and hobbies, I love being outdoors and playing football. Indoors, I write poems and read books. 


## Research interests

In broad terms, I am working on evolutionary game theory to study the dynamics of biological systems. My work involves studying deterministic dynamics to gain a deeper understanding of evolution. I am also exploring stochastic dynamics to model biological systems more realistically. I also work on integrating structured populations into evolutionary game theory with the aim of understanding how cooperation might increase in populations. Regarding the biological aspect, I aim to understand cellular burn wound dynamics using EGT + structured populations. Apart from my Bachelor's thesis topic, I am also interested in exploring theoretical biophysics and computational biology.
