## Who am I?

I was born and grew up in Puebla, a city located in east-central Mexico. I have a background in ethnomusicology (M.A. National University of Mexico, UNAM) and philosophy of science (PhD, UNAM). During my doctoral studies, I was a visiting student at the Centre for Music and Science at the University of Cambridge (January-June 2016) and a writing-up fellow at the Konrad Lorenz Institute for Evolution and Cognition Research (KLI) in Klosterneuburg, near Vienna (March-September 2018). After completing my PhD, I conducted a research stay at the Institute of Musicology of the University of Vienna (June-December 2020), followed by a postdoctoral fellowship at the KLI (January 2021-March 2023) where I stayed as a guest researcher until March 2024. Additionally, from October 2021 to September 2023, I held a lectureship in Mexican traditional music at the University for Music and Performing Arts in Vienna (MDW). I have also conducted fieldwork with indigenous groups in Mexico for several years, studying and immersing myself in their musical traditions. 

## Research interests

My work is situated at the intersection between evolutionary biology, cultural evolution, cognitive sciences of music and ethnomusicology. I am currently interested in analyzing processes of musical transmission and change using conceptual tools from evolutionary developmental biology. My research aims to develop a theoretical framework to have a better understanding of the complex dynamics of cultural inheritance and change that operate across distinct temporal and spatial scales.
