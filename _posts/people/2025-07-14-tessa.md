## Who am I?
    
I was born and raised near Munich but moved to Ulm for my Bachelor's degree in Psychology. Since I wanted to get to know yet another city, I then started my Master's degree in Würzburg. Here, I am currently studying Clinical Psychology, Psychotherapy and Clinical Neuroscience. As a therapist to-be I am especially interested in analyzing complex emotions and making sense of human behavior in various contexts. This interest for emotions is also reflected in my passion for poetry, which I like to read or write. Apart from that, I love watching documentaries (e.g. about the universe, physics or math problems), working on my spanish or catching up on general geography education. My broad range of interests is also the reason why I enjoy interdisciplinary research - this has actually brought me to the CCTB. To balance out my physically inactive hobbies I love to go bouldering and swimming. 
    
    


## Research interests

  I have always been interested in any kind of art and the corresponding emotions it can evoke. Especially the paradoxical enjoyment of sad art sparked my interest. One approach to investigate this phenomenon, where people like to deliberately expose themselves to supposedly aversive stimuli, is examining people's emotional reaction to sad music. 
    
  Following that approach, during my Bachelor's degree I worked on a project that analyzed the relationship between personality, music streaming behavior and the tendency to prefer sad music as a form of emotion regulation. To assess the music streaming behavior I looked at spotify streaming histories to gain an impression that is as authentic and close to real everyday behavior as possible. 
  In my current role as a student assistent, I want to follow up on this topic and investigate the hypothesis that sad music can prepare its listeners for similar emotional experiences in the real world.
